# win-capture-audio

An OBS plugin similar to OBS's win-capture/game-capture that allows for audio capture from a specific application, rather than the system's audio as a whole. This eliminates the need for third-party software or hardware audio mixing tools that introduce complexity, and in the case of software tools, introduce mandatory latency.

Internally it uses [ActivateAudioInterfaceAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/mmdeviceapi/nf-mmdeviceapi-activateaudiointerfaceasync) with [AUDIOCLIENT_PROCESS_LOOPBACK_PARAMS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/audioclientactivationparams/ns-audioclientactivationparams-audioclient_process_loopback_params). This initialization structure is only officially available on Windows 11, however it appears to work additionally on relatively recent versions of Windows 10.

**This plugin is in a BETA state, expect issues - [https://discord.gg/4D5Yk5gFnM](https://discord.gg/4D5Yk5gFnM) for support and updates.**<br/>
**An updated version of Windows 10 2004 (released 2020-05-27) or later is required.**

## Installation and Usage

1. Head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/bozbez/win-capture-audio/releases) page and download the latest installer (or zip if you are using a portable installation)
2. Run the setup wizard, selecting your root OBS folder (`obs-studio/`, _not_ `obs-studio/obs-plugins/`) when asked (or extract the zip to the portable OBS root directory)
3. Launch OBS and check out the newly available "Application Audio Output Capture" source

## Troubleshooting

- **Application Audio Output Capture source not showing up after install:** this means that either your OBS is out-of-date (check that it is at least 27.1.x) or you have installed the plugin to the wrong location. To re-install, first uninstall via "Add or remove programs" in the Windows settings, and then run the installer again. Make sure to select the top-level `obs-studio/` folder in (probably) `C:/Program Files/`.

- **Application Audio Output Capture source not picking up any audio:** this happens when your Windows is too old and does not have support for the API. Note that even if you have a more recent major version such as `20H2` you will still need the latest updates for the plugin to work. If you are on a very old version you might need more than one update for this to work, and the second update might not show up for a few days after the first update.
